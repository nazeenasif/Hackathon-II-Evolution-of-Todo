response_text: "# Implementation Tasks: Frontend & API Integration for Multi-User Todo Application\n\n## Phase 1: Project Setup\n\n- [ ] T001 Initialize Next.js 16+ project with App Router in frontend/ directory\n- [ ] T002 Configure Tailwind CSS for the Next.js application\n- [ ] T003 Create .env.local file with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL\n- [ ] T004 Install Better Auth and related dependencies (better-auth, @better-auth/react)\n- [ ] T005 Install API client and utility dependencies (axios, react-icons)\n\n## Phase 2: Foundational Components\n\n- [ ] T006 Create lib/auth.js with Better Auth configuration\n- [ ] T007 Create lib/api.js with axios client and JWT token interceptor\n- [ ] T008 Create services/taskService.js with all API endpoint functions\n- [ ] T009 Create types/taskTypes.ts with all TypeScript interfaces for tasks\n- [ ] T010 Create components/ui directory with basic reusable UI components (Button, Input, etc.)\n\n## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Secure User Access (Priority: P1)\n\n**Goal**: Enable secure user authentication with Better Auth so users can access their personal tasks.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering/logging in with Better Auth, receiving a JWT token, and successfully accessing the todo application dashboard. The authentication flow should work seamlessly with proper error handling.\n\n- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Create /pages/api/auth/[...auth].js route for Better Auth\n- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create /components/ProtectedRoute.jsx for authentication middleware\n- [ ] T013 [US1] Create /pages/signin.jsx with login form using Better Auth\n- [ ] T014 [US1] Create /pages/signup.jsx with registration form using Better Auth\n- [ ] T015 [US1] Create /components/Header.jsx with user profile and logout functionality\n- [ ] T016 [US1] Implement JWT token storage and retrieval in localStorage\n- [ ] T017 [US1] Test authentication flow with successful login and token storage\n\n## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Task Management Interface (Priority: P2)\n\n**Goal**: Provide an intuitive interface for users to manage their tasks with CRUD operations.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, creating new tasks, viewing existing tasks, updating task details, and deleting tasks. The UI should be responsive and provide appropriate feedback for all operations.\n\n- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Create /components/TaskCard.jsx for displaying individual tasks\n- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Create /components/TaskList.jsx for displaying list of tasks\n- [ ] T020 [US2] Create /components/TaskForm.jsx for creating and editing tasks\n- [ ] T021 [US2] Create /pages/dashboard.jsx as main dashboard with task list\n- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement task creation functionality with API integration\n- [ ] T023 [US2] Implement task update functionality with API integration\n- [ ] T024 [US2] Implement task deletion functionality with API integration\n- [ ] T025 [US2] Implement task completion toggle with API integration\n- [ ] T026 [US2] Add loading states and error handling to all task operations\n\n## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Advanced Task Features (Priority: P3)\n\n**Goal**: Allow users to organize tasks using priorities, tags, search, and sorting capabilities.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating tasks with various priorities, tags, due dates, then using search, filter, and sort functions to organize and find tasks effectively.\n\n- [ ] T027 [P] [US3] Create /components/PriorityBadge.jsx for visual priority indicators\n- [ ] T028 [P] [US3] Create /components/TagList.jsx for displaying task tags\n- [ ] T029 [US3] Create /components/SearchFilterBar.jsx with search, filter, and sort controls\n- [ ] T030 [US3] Implement priority filtering in TaskList component\n- [ ] T031 [US3] Implement tag filtering in TaskList component\n- [ ] T032 [US3] Implement completion status filtering in TaskList component\n- [ ] T033 [US3] Implement search functionality in TaskList component\n- [ ] T034 [US3] Implement sorting controls (by due date, priority, title) in TaskList component\n- [ ] T035 [US3] Add due date display and filtering capability\n\n## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\n- [ ] T036 Create responsive layout components for mobile/tablet/desktop\n- [ ] T037 Implement global error handling for API responses\n- [ ] T038 Add user-friendly error messages for failed API requests\n- [ ] T039 Implement optimistic updates for better UX\n- [ ] T040 Add loading skeletons for better perceived performance\n- [ ] T041 Create /pages/_app.jsx with global providers and error boundaries\n- [ ] T042 Create /pages/index.jsx as landing page with call to action\n- [ ] T043 Add proper meta tags and SEO configuration\n- [ ] T044 Update README.md with frontend setup instructions\n- [ ] T045 Perform end-to-end testing of all features with multiple users\n- [ ] T046 Verify all functional requirements from spec are met\n- [ ] T047 Test responsive design on different screen sizes\n- [ ] T048 Validate accessibility compliance\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- User Story 2 (Task Management Interface) depends on User Story 1 (Secure User Access) - requires authentication to be in place first\n- User Story 3 (Advanced Task Features) depends on User Story 2 (Task Management Interface) - requires basic CRUD operations first\n\n## Parallel Execution Opportunities\n\n- Within User Story 1: Authentication routes and UI components can be developed in parallel ([P] marked tasks)\n- Within User Story 2: Task display and form components can be developed in parallel ([P] marked tasks)\n- Within User Story 3: Priority and tag components can be developed in parallel ([P] marked tasks)\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n- MVP Scope: Complete Phase 1 (Setup), Phase 2 (Foundational), and Phase 3 (User Story 1) for basic authentication and dashboard access\n- Incremental Delivery: Add task management in Phase 4, then advanced features in Phase 5\n- Each phase builds upon the previous one while maintaining independently testable functionality"
outcome: "Created comprehensive task list for frontend integration with Next.js, Better Auth, and API connectivity"
evaluation: "Tasks are organized by user stories with clear priorities, dependencies, and parallel execution opportunities. Each task follows the required format with IDs, story labels, and file paths."
