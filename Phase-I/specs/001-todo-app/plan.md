# Implementation Plan: In-Memory Python Console Todo Application

**Branch**: `001-todo-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-30 | **Spec**: [specs/001-todo-app/spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a Python console-based todo application that stores all data in memory only. The application will provide core functionality for adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and marking tasks as complete/incomplete through a numbered menu interface. Built with Python 3.13+ using only standard library components as required by the constitution.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard Python library only (as per constitution)
**Storage**: In-memory only (no persistence - as per constitution)
**Testing**: pytest (standard Python testing framework)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single console application
**Performance Goals**: <100ms response time for all operations, <50MB memory usage for typical usage
**Constraints**: No file system access, no external dependencies, console-based interface only
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, in-memory storage, <1000 tasks typical usage

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Compliance Check:**
- ✅ Spec-First Development: Following approved specification from spec.md
- ✅ Phase Isolation: Only implementing Phase I functionality as specified
- ✅ No Manual Coding: All code will be generated by Claude Code
- ✅ In-Memory Only: Data storage will be in-memory only, no file system access
- ✅ Technology Constraints: Using Python 3.13+, UV package manager, CLI application only, standard library only
- ✅ Clean Architecture: Separating concerns between data models, business logic, CLI interface, and entry point
- ✅ Deterministic Behavior: Using predictable ID assignment and consistent behavior
- ✅ Input Validation & Errors: All user input will be validated with clear error messages
- ✅ Console UX Rules: Implementing clear numbered menu interface
- ✅ No Scope Creep: Only implementing the 5 core features (add, view, update, delete, mark complete/incomplete)
- ✅ Spec-Kit Plus Compliance: Following all required formats and conventions
- ✅ Agent Accountability: All decisions documented with rationale

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected as appropriate for a console application. The structure separates concerns as required by the constitution: data models in models/, business logic in services/, CLI interface in cli/, and entry point as main.py.
