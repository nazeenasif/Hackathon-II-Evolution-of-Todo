# Hackathon Phase I – In-Memory Python Console Todo App

## Project Overview
This project is a simple In-Memory Todo Application built using Python as a console-based program. 
The goal of this phase is to demonstrate clean logic, correct use of data structures, and basic CRUD functionality without using any database or external storage.

The application runs completely in memory, meaning all data is stored temporarily while the program is running.

---

## Problem Statement
Many beginners struggle to understand how real applications manage tasks, data flow, and user interaction.
This project solves that problem by providing a clear, beginner-friendly Todo system that demonstrates:

- How to structure a Python program
- How to manage data in memory
- How to interact with users through a console menu

---

## Key Features
- Add new todo tasks
- View all todo tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Simple menu-driven console interface
- Uses Python lists and dictionaries for in-memory storage
- No database or file storage used

---

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Environment: Console / Terminal
- Storage: In-memory data structures only

---

## How the Application Works
1. The program starts and displays a menu to the user.
2. The user selects an option by entering a number.
3. Based on the selection, the program:
   - Adds a task
   - Displays tasks
   - Updates task status
   - Deletes a task
4. All tasks are stored temporarily in memory.
5. When the program exits, all data is cleared.

## Why In-Memory?
This hackathon phase focuses on:
- Core programming logic
- Data handling without complexity
- Preparing a foundation for future phases where persistence and UI may be added

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding Python control flow
- Using lists and dictionaries effectively
- Writing clean, readable console applications
- Handling user input safely
- Structuring a small real-world project

## Demo Flow for Video
Suggested demo flow for a 90-second video:
1. Brief intro to the problem
2. Explain what an in-memory Todo app is
3. Show the menu interface
4. Add a todo task
5. View tasks
6. Mark a task as completed
7. Delete a task
8. Explain how this sets the base for future phases

## Future Improvements
- File-based persistence
- GUI or web interface
- User authentication
- Priority-based tasks
- Deadline reminders

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a strong foundation in Python programming and logical problem-solving.
It is designed to be simple, clear, and extensible for future hackathon phases.
